Such expressions allow filters to be specified in fulltext and\n * can be combined with boolean operators to build complex queries.\n *\n * A single fielded search clause has this form:\n * ``<fieldname>[`display value`]:[:][<operator>]<value>``\n *\n * A field name is either a column name or alias or a partname. In the case of a partname and column name clashing then\n * the field is treated as a column. Two colons can be specified as the separator to denote that the field is a partname.\n * An optional display value can follow the fieldname enclosed in backquote characters\n *\n * Operators are: `=` (default), `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `~` (regexp)\n * In addition, a regular expression can be specified by enclosing the value in `/` characters\n *\n * An inclusive range of values can be specified using a square bracket syntax: `[value1..value2]`\n * An exclusive range of values can be specified using a curly bracket syntax: `{value1..value2}`\n * The brackets can be mixed. For example: `age:{5..13]` expresses `13 >= age > 5`.\n *\n * For multi-value csv fields an `IN` condition can be expressed using a comma-separated list of values enclosed in square brackets.\n * For example: `authors:[Proust, Orwell, Dickens]`\n *\n * If a value contains reserved characters then it can be enclosed in backquote characters to prevent the parser interpreting them\n * incorrectly. For example: ``code: `a:b:c` ``\n *\n * The parser also supports a NEAR operator to allow searching for terms close to each other. There are two forms suppported:\n * * infix - `term1 NEAR[/n] term2` where `n` is the maximum number of words between the two terms for them to match\n * * function - `NEAR[/n](term1, term2, term3, ...)` where `n` is \"window\" size within which all the terms must be present for them\n * to match. The minimum useful value for n is thus equal to the number of terms passed to the operator.\n *\n * Fielded search expresions can be combined with the boolean operators `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` and brackets used for grouping.\n * For example: `football (age:>=7 AND (name:smith OR name:jones))`\n */\nexport class ExprParser {\n\n    public static fieldPartnamePrefix = \"@\";\n    private static parsetbl: Act[][] = [\n    /* stk  ------------- input ------------*/\n    /*\t\t                                 INFIX                  */\n    /*\t\t         OR\t   AND\t NOT   NEAR  NEAR  (\t  )\t     $  */\n    /*OR */         [Act.r, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.r, Act.r],\n    /*AND*/         [Act.r, Act.r, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.r, Act.r],\n    /*NOT*/         [Act.r, Act.r, Act.s, Act.s, Act.r, Act.s, Act.r, Act.r],\n    /*NEAR*/        [Act.r, Act.r, Act.s, Act.s, Act.r, Act.s, Act.r, Act.r],\n    /*INFIXNEAR*/   [Act.r, Act.r, Act.s, Act.s, Act.r, Act.s, Act.r, Act.r],\n    /*(*/           [Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.e1],\n    /*)*/           [Act.r, Act.r, Act.r, Act.r, Act.r, Act.e2, Act.r, Act.r],\n    /*$*/           [Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.s, Act.e3, Act.a]\n    ];\n\n    private exprContext: ExprContext;\n    private options: ExprParserOptions;\n    private expressions: Expr[];\n    private operators: ExprParserOperator[];\n    private fields: string[]; // pushed on '(', popped on ')'\n    private displays: string[]; // pushed on '(', popped on ')'\n    private op: ExprParserOperator;\n    private prevOp: ExprParserOperator;\n    private saveOp: ExprParserOperator; // for default conjunction operator\n    private field: string;\n    private display: string;\n    private text: string;\n    private current: number;\n    private length: number;\n\n    private constructor(exprContext: ExprContext, options?: ExprParserOptions) {\n        this.exprContext = exprContext;\n        this.options = options || {};\n        this.exprContext.disallowFulltext = this.options.disallowFulltext;\n        this.expressions = [];\n        this.operators = [];\n        this.fields = [];\n        this.displays = [];\n        this.text = \"\";\n        this.current = 0;\n        this.length = 0;\n        this.op = this.prevOp = this.saveOp = ExprParserOperator.invalid;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Escape a string so that the characters in it are not processed by the fielded search expression parser.\n     * Single occurrences of the backslash character are replaced by two backslashes and backquote characters\n     * are prefixed by a backslash.
