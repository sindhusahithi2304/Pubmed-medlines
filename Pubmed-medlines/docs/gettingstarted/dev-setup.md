# Developer-side setup

## Prerequisites

To develop a SBA, developers need to install various utilities:

- [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/): Node and npm (Node Package Manager) are required to download and manage the dependencies of the project (like the [Angular](https://angular.io) library).
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The standard IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Angular development.
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/): The version control system allowing you to sync your workspace with a Git or Github repository, work collaboratively and deploy the project on a server.

![Git]({{site.baseurl}}assets/gettingstarted/git.png){: width="180px" .ml-5}

## Minimum Development

It is possible to use sample applications, like [Vanilla Search]({{site.baseurl}}modules/vanilla-search/vanilla-search.html), out-of-the-box on the Sinequa server. You have to [**unzip the default workspace**](server-setup.html#unzip-the-sinequa-angular-workspace), and [**reference one of the applications in your App**](#deploying-an-app-on-a-sinequa-server).

After this, your app will be served at `http(s)://<sinequa server>/app/your-app` and fully operational.

⚠️ Note that the apps packaged in the zipped workspace automatically detect and fetch some settings from the server, like the name of the App configured on the server and the authentication settings of the WebApp. This capability is not activated by default in the workspace available on this Github repository.

In the general case, to connect the app with your own server, edit [`projects/vanilla-search/src/app/app-module.ts`](https://github.com/sinequa/sba-angular/blob/master/projects/vanilla-search/src/app/app.module.ts) and set the following `StartConfig`:

```ts
export const startConfig: StartConfig = {
    app: "<NAME OF YOUR APP>",
    production: environment.production,
    auditEnabled: true
};
```

Then rebuild your app from the Workspace "Build Scripts" section: Your app should now be working correctly.

## Angular Workspace

The workspace of the SBA Framework is a directory that contains multiple libraries and apps, which share the same global configuration and dependencies (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `angular.json`). For more information, please refer to the [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure#multiple-projects) on this topic.

As explained in the [introduction]({{site.baseurl}}intro), the SBA framework is based on an Angular Workspace containing three libraries ([`@sinequa/core`]({{site.baseurl}}modules/core/core.html), [`@sinequa/components`]({{site.baseurl}}modules/components/components.html)) and [`@sinequa/analytics`]({{site.baseurl}}modules/analytics/analytics.html)). This workspace is available from the Sinequa releases as a zip file (see [Server-side setup](server-setup.html#workspaces)) or directly from [this Github repository](https://github.com/sinequa/sba-angular).

Once downloaded or cloned on the developer's computer, the workspace can be opened in Visual Studio Code (*Add Folder to Workspace* > *Open the root of the Workspace*).

*Workspace opened in Visual Studio Code*

## Dependencies

An Angular project can have many **dependencies**, starting with Angular itself. The list of dependencies is listed in the `package.json` file at the root of the workspace. If the workspace is downloaded or cloned without its dependencies, the developer will need to install them.

In Visual Studio Code, open a **Terminal** (*Terminal > New Terminal*).

In the terminal run:

```bash
npm install
```

This takes a few minutes to run. npm downloads the required libraries from the Internet and stores them in the `node_modules/` folder at the root of the workspace. You can ignore the recommendations to run `npm audit fix` at the end of the process.

The dependencies can be updated by increasing the version number of a given library in `package.json` and running `npm install` again.

For example, to upgrate the Bootstrap library, just increment the version on this line:

```json
"bootstrap": "^4.4.1"
```

⚠️ **We will keep updating dependencies in future versions of the workspaces we deliver.** If you want to update your workspace, you will need to update your `package.json` (potentially resolving conflicts with your own custom libraries) and re-run `npm install`. Such updates are generally not backward compatible (for example, new Angular version may use different syntax), and so require changes in your libs and applications.
{: .fs-2 .p-3 }

## Building the libraries

The workspace includes three libraries: [`@sinequa/core`]({{site.baseurl}}modules/core/core.html), [`@sinequa/components`]({{site.baseurl}}modules/components/components.html) and [`@sinequa/analytics`]({{site.baseurl}}modules/analytics/analytics.html). These libraries need to be compiled before the apps. In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm run buildcore
npm run buildcomponents
npm run buildanalytics
```

<div markdown="1" class="fs-2 p-3">
Note that we use `npm run`, followed by the name of a command defined in the **scripts** section of the `package.json` rather than just calling `ng build core` directly. This allows:
- The command to work even if Angular CLI is not installed globally.
- To run the command with increased memory as specified in the `.npmrc` file.
</div>

The libraries are built to the `/dist` folder at the root of your workspace. If you import code from `@sinequa/core` or `@sinequa/components`, this is where it comes from.

Just like for the [dependencies](#dependencies), these three libraries will be regularly updated. Do not forget to re-run these build commands when you download or pull a new version of the workspace.

## Building an app

At this point you are ready to build one of the sample applications included in the workspace. The only thing missing is the name of your App on this server. You need to specify it in the `src/app/app.module.ts` file:

```ts
export const startConfig: StartConfig = {
    app: "<name of your app>",
    production: environment.production
};
```

For example, if you named your app "my-app" in the [Server-side setup](server-setup.html), this might look like this:

```ts
export const startConfig: StartConfig = {
    app: "my-app",
    production: environment.production
};
```

You can now build and serve the app with:

```bash
npm run ng serve hello-search
```

If the build is successful, you can access your app by navigating to [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200) in your favorite browser.

Unfortunately, at this point your app probably fails because the Angular application is sending requests to `localhost:4200`, but your Sinequa API is served at a different location!

![Server error]({{site.baseurl}}assets/gettingstarted/server-error.png)

To solve this problem, we can configure a **proxy** to redirect the requests from `localhost:4200` to your server. Open the `hello-search/src/proxy.conf.json` file. If Sinequa runs on your own computer on the default port, the configuration should look like this:

```json
{
    "/api": {
      "target": "http://localhost",
      "secure": false
    },

    "/xdownload": {
        "target": "http://locahost",
        "secure": false
    }
}
```

Complete documentation about the proxy configuration is available in the [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/build#proxying-to-a-backend-server) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverproxy) documentation.

Now run the following command:

```bash
npm run ng serve hello-search -- --proxyConfig=./projects/hello-search/src/proxy.conf.json
```

Now your app should work!

![Hello Search Works]({{site.baseurl}}assets/gettingstarted/hello-search-works.png)

Log in to the app with the same credentials as you would to log in to the administration interface. If you have set up a custom login method (SSO, SAML, OAuth...) on the Sinequa webapp, you may need to customize the `app.module.ts` a bit further (see [Login methods]({{site.baseurl}}tipstricks/login-methods.html)).

## Deploying an app on a Sinequa server

To deploy your app on the Sinequa server:

- Build the app with the production flag: `ng build hello-search --prod` (it will be built under the `dist/` folder)
- Upload your workspace on the Sinequa server, in `<sinequa directory>\data\sba\` (either via file transfer or preferably a `git pull` -- See [Workflows](workflow.html))
- In the administration, open your app (under *Search-Based Applications > Apps*) and set the **Workspace application** to the one you uploaded.

![Workspace application]({{site.baseurl}}assets/gettingstarted/admin-deploy.png){: .d-block .mx-auto }

Your app is now served by Sinequa at the URL `http://<sinequa server>/app/<name of your App>` (note that `name of you App` refers to the name of the App object in the administration, not the name of the Angular project).

Note that if the URL of the Sinequa server is different between development and production settings, you will need to use the `src/environments` files to differentiate between these two (See [Environment]({{site.baseurl}}tipstricks/environment.html)).

## Deploying an app on another server

An SBA can be deployed on any kind of server, like any other Angular application. However, we have the same problem as above: If we do nothing, the HTTP requests will be directed to the host server instead of the Sinequa server.

There are two ways of solving this:

- Use a **proxy**, similarly as above, but this time with a real production proxy.
- Enable **cross-origin requests**. The Sinequa Webapp needs to be properly configured to enable this (See [CORS and WebApp configuration](server-setup.html#cors-and-webapp-configuration)). Additionally the Sinequa server needs to be served over HTTPS, due to strict restrictions of CORS by the modern web browsers.

    In your `app.module.ts`, add the URL of the Sinequa server in the `StartConfig` object:

    ```ts
    export const startConfig: StartConfig = {
        url: "https://my-sinequa-server",
        app: "<name of your app>",
        production: environment.production
    };
    ```

    Note that this configuration replaces the `ng serve` proxy configuration.

    ⚠️ Even with HTTPS enabled, CORS will limit some of functionalities of the SBA framework, like the interaction with the content of the preview (See [`PreviewDocument`]({{site.baseurl}}modules/components/preview.html#preview-document)).
