# Contributing to the docs

Contributing to the SBA documentation is possible via Pull Requests on Github. The documentation is part of the same repository as the SBA source code (located under the `docs/` folder).

## Getting Started

The SBA documentation website is based on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The following instructions let you build and review the website on your local computer before pushing the documentation online.

- Download and Install a Ruby+Devkit version from [RubyInstaller Downloads](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). Use default options for installation.
- Run the ridk install step on the last stage of the installation wizard. This is needed for installing gems with native extensions. You can find additional information regarding this in the RubyInstaller Documentation.
- Open a new terminal in your repository, run `cd ./docs` and run `bundle install`: This should install Jekyll and other dependencies.
- In the `docs/_config.yml` file, replace `remote_theme: pmarsceill/just-the-docs` by `theme: just-the-docs` (**do not commit that change!** it is only meant for working locally, but will break the site if pushed to Github).
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and navigate to http://localhost:4000
- Now you can edit the markdown files in `docs/` and its subdirectories and the website should update automatically.

## Documentation content

Note that the documentation website includes two types of sources:

- Auto-generated files (using [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/)). These need to be manually generated by running `npm run makedoc-core` and `npm run makedoc-components` at the root of the repository. These commands generate the content of the `docs/core` and `docs/components` folders (which must not be modified manually).
- The rest of the website is composed of markdown files (`.md`) which are automatically transformed into HTML by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). For example, check the content of `docs/tutorial`, `docs/modules` or `docs/tipstricks`. Note that all the images are centralized under the `docs/assets` folder.
